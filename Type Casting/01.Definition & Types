Type Casting :- The process of converting one datatype into another datatype is called as Type Casting.

1. Primitive Type Casting :- The process of converting one primitive datatype to another primitive datatype is
                             called primitive Type Casting.

                              byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double

    i. Widening  :- The process of converting lower range datatype into higher range datatype is
                    called Widening.
                 -> Widening is also known as Emplicity Type Casting & AutoWidening.
                 -> In this process, there is no data loss.

   ii. Narrowing :- The process of converting higher range datatype into lower range datatype is
                    called Widening.
                 -> Widening is also known as Explicity Type Casting.
                 -> In this process, there is chances of data loss.
                 -> We can achieve narrowing by using typecast operator. 

                            syntax:- (lower range datatype) higher range datatype literal variable;

* Important Notes :-
--> We can not convert Boolean datatype to Other Datatype.
--> We can convert long value to float value implicitily(Autowidening Type Cast) because long datatype stores value int binary format in 
    memory but float datatype stores the value in the form of exponential.
        Ex :- Value = 8 , In long type it will be stored like - 1000 , In float type it will be stored like - 2^3.
