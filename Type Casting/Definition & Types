1. Primitive Type Casting :- The process of converting one primitive datatype to another primitive datatype is
                             called primitive Type Casting.

    i. Widening  :- The process of converting lower range datatype into higher range datatype is
                    called Widening.
                 -> Widening is also known as Emplicity Type Casting & AutoWidening.
                 -> In this process, there is no data loss.

   ii. Narrowing :- The process of converting higher range datatype into lower range datatype is
                    called Widening.
                 -> Widening is also known as Explicity Type Casting.
                 -> In this process, there is chances of data loss.
                 -> We can achieve narrowing by using typecast operator. 
                            syntax:- (lower range datatype) higher range datatype literal variable;
