Method Overloading :- Creating multiple methods with same name & different formal argument is known as Method Overloading.
--> While Overloading a method argument or number of argument should be different.
--> In method overloading java matches method call to method implementation based on method name & arguments.
--> Method Overloading does not depend on return type.

* When We will go for Method Overloading ?

Ans :- When we need different different implementation for a particular or same behaviour, when arguments are  
       different.

* Can We Overload main() ?

Ans :- Yes, we can overload main(). 
       But JVM always calls the main(), which main() have signature as main(String [] args).

Advantages of Method Overloading :- 
--> By Method Overloading we can achieve Code-Reusability.
--> By Method Overloading we can achieve Compile-Time Polymorphism.
--> By Method Overloading we can achieve Code-Readability.
