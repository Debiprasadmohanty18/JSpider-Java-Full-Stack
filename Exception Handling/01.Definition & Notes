=> Exception :-
================
--> Exception is an interruption, it will occurs during execution of program at runtime.
								OR
--> Exception is an unwanted event occurs during program execution which terminates the flow of program abnormally.
-->When exception will occur the program will get terminated abnormally.
--> To continue the flow of our execution we need to handle the exceptions.


Q - WHAT IS EXCEPTION HANDLING ?
Answer :- Exception handling is a mechanism used to handle the exceptions.
--> By using exception handling we can continue the flow of execution.

--> To handle the exception java provides some exception handling keywords :
				1 - try...catch
				2 - throw
				3 - throws
				4 - finally
				
--> in java, we cann't handle errors, we can debug errors.

1 - try :-
===========
--> 'try' is an exception handling keyword.
--> It is used to write risk lines of code.
--> We cann't write try block alone, It is always associated with catch block.
--> We can write multiple catch block for one try block.
--> While writing multiple catch block we have to follow the order i.e Sub type to Super type.
--> After declaring Super Exception type catch block, we should not declare any catch block which is sub type of Exception class.

2 - catch :- 
=============
--> catch is an exception handling keyword.
--> It is used to provide alternate solution for exception.
--> We cann't write catch block alone, It will always associated with try block.
--> catch block will get executed when exception will occur inside try block.

3 - throw :-
=============
--> It is a keyword used to throw the exception.
--> Using throw keyword we can throw only one exception at a time.
--> Using throw keyword we can throw both checked and unchecked exception.
--> We can use 'throw' keyword inside a method.

4 - throws :- 
==============
--> It is a keyword used to declare the exception(Propagation).
--> Using 'throws' keyword we can propagate multiple exception.
--> 'throws' keyword mainly used to declare checked exception.
--> 'throws' keyword is used along with method declaration. 

5 - finally :-
===============
--> "finally" is a keyword using in exception handling.
--> "finally" keyword is used to declare the 'finally' block.
--> We cann't use 'finally' block alone, we can write finally block in two ways i.e 1 - try with finally ,  2 - try...catch with finally
--> 'finally' block is used to write costly resources like database , file-closing connection etc.
--> 'finally' block will get executed every time if exception will occur or not.
--> 'finally' block will get executed before executing "return" statement.
--> 'finally block will not get executed, if exit(System.exit(0);) is present before 'finally' block.


=> Default Exception Handling :-
=================================
--> If programmer failed to handle the exception, JVM will handle the exception by terminating current execution, this process is called as default exception handling.
--> Default exception handling is not an actual exception handling.


=> Unchecked Exception :- 
==========================
--> Which exceptions are sub classes of RuntimeException class those exceptions are called as Unchecked exception.
--> It is also known as compiler unknown exceptions.
--> Handling is not mandatory for unchecked exception(Compiler will not force to handle unchecked exception).
--> Propagation is implicit for unchecked exception.
 Example :- ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException , .. etc
 
 
=> Checked Exception :- 
========================
--> Which exceptions are not sub classes of RuntimeException class those exceptions are called as Checked exception.
--> It is also known as compiler known exceptions.
--> Handling is mandatory for Checked exception(Compiler will force to handle Checked exception).
--> If Checked exception is not handled compiler will throw compile time error.
 Example :- FileNotFoundException, ClassNotFoundException,... etc.
 
=> Exception Propagation :- 
============================
--> Passing an exception to it's caller method is called as exception propagation.
--> We can propagate the exception by using 'throws' keyword.
--> For Unchecked exception, propagation is implicit.
--> We can propagate Checked Exceptions by using 'throws' keyword.
--> By Using 'throws' keyword we can propagate multiple exception at a time.
--> 'throws' declaration is mandatory for UnHandled Checked Exception.
