=> MultiThreading :-
=====================
--> MultiThreading is used to achieve multitasking.
--> Multitasking is of two types.
	1 - Process Based Multitasking
	2 - Thread Based Multitasking
	
1 - Process Based Multitasking :-
==================================
--> Executing multiple process simultaneously is called as process based multitasking.
--> It is using in Operating System level.
--> It is also known as Heavy Weight Process.

2 - Thread Based Multitasking :-
=================================
--> Executing multiple threads simultaneously is called as thread based multitasking.
--> It is using in Programmatic level.
--> It is also known as Light Weight Process.
--> Multiple threads will use some Shared Resources.

=> Thread :-
=============
--> Thread is a Light Weight sub-process in java.
--> When java program executing, JVM will create three threads.
		1 - Main Thread
		2 - GC Thread
		3 - Scheduler Thread
--> In java, we can create threads in two ways by using 
											1 - Thread Class
											2 - Runnable Interface
											
=> Threads Execution :- 
========================
--> In java, threads will execute in a parallel manner.
--> Every thread will maintain separate stack memory.
--> If any problem occurs in one thread, it will not affect another thread execution.
--> Threads will get executed when start() is called.
--> We should not call start() twice by using same thread instance variable.

* Thread has three properties.
		1 - Thread Name
		2 - Thread ID
		3 - Thread Priority
