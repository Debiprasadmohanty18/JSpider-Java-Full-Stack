=> Non-Primitive Type Casting :-
=================================
--> In Java, all classes and interfaces are non-primitive type.
--> The Process of converting one non-promitive type into another non-primitive type is known as non-primitive type casting.
--> To achieve non-primitive type casting "Is-A" relationship is mandatory.
--> It is of two types :-
		1 - Upcasting
		2 - Downcasting

Example-1 :- 
							->--->----->----->FRUIT<-----<-----<---<--
							↑		  ↓   ↓			 ↑
			↑ Upcasting	    		↑  Downcasting ↓  ↓   ↓   ↓ Downcasting  ↑     Upcasting ↑
							↑		  ↓   ↓			 ↑
							<--<---APPLE<---<-↓   ↓->--->MANGO->-->-->
								 ↑			 ↑
								 ↑			 ↑
								 -------❌------❌-------
								  Type Cast not Possible.		

  In above Example, We can type cast FRUIT to APPLE, APPLE to FRUIT and also we can type cast FRUIT to MANGO, MANGO to FRUIT.
But, we cann't type cast APPLE to MANGO why because there is no "Is-A" relationship between APPLE to MANGO.

Example-2 :- 
				  				--->->A<-<---
				  		  Upcasting     ↑     ↑     ↑
				  				↑     |     ↑
				  				--<---B     ↑  Upcasting
				  				↓     ↑     ↑
				  		  Upcasting     ↓     |     ↑
				  				--->->C-->->-
