--> Upcasting is an implicit type casting.
--> Upcasting is also known as Auto-Upcasting.
--> To achieve upcasting "IS-A" relationship is mandatory.
--> By using upcasted variable we can access only generic variables.
--> By using upcasted reference variable we cann't access sub class specific properties.
--> By using upcasting we can achieve generalization.(The Process of creating generalizated container)
