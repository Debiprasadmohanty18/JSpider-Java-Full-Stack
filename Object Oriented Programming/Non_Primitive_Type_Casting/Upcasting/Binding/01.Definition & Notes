=> Binding :-
==============
--> Connecting a method call to its method implementation is called binding.
--> There are two types of Binding :-
		1 - Early Binding 
		2 - Late Binding

1-Early Binding :-
=====================
--> Connecting a method call to its method implementation at compile time by compiler based on method name and arguments is called as Early Binding.
--> Early Binding is also known as static or compile-time binding.
--> All data members(Variable) are binded at compile time.
--> When overloaded method is called, Early binding will takes place.
--> For static, private & final methods early binding will happen when it is called.

2-Late Binding :-
==================
--> Connecting a method call to its method implementation at run time by JVM based on instance we created is called as Late Binding.
--> Late Binding is also known as Dynamic Binding or Run time Binding or Dynamic Method Dispatch.
--> When overridden method is called, Late binding will takes place.
--> For non-static, non-private & non-final methods late binding will happen when it is called.

=================================================|======================================================	
-> Early Binding done by Compiler at Compile time|-> Late Binding done by JVM at Run time 	
-> Data members, static, private, final binding	 |-> Non-static, non-private, non-final methods are	
	    at compile time.			 |	      binded at run time.
-> We can achieve Early Binding using method	 |-> We can achieve late binding using method Overriding.
