=> Downcasting :-
===================
--> The process of converting super type reference into sub type reference is called as Downcasting.
--> We cann't achieve downcasting without upcasting.
--> Downcasting is an explicit type casting.
--> To achieve downcasting, type-cast operator is mandatory.
--> By using upcasted reference we cann't access sub class specific property.
--> To refer sub class specific property super class reference should be downcast for sub type.

Q-1 :- WHEN WE WILL GET CLASS CAST EXCEPTION ?
Answer :- Class cast exception is a unchecked exception.
-> It occurs in two scenario :-
1 - Without upcasting if we tried to do downcasting we will get class cast exception.
2 - If upcasted reference type and downcasted reference type both are different then we will gwt class cast exception.


--> We can avoid class cast exception by using "instanceOf" keyword while downcasting.
