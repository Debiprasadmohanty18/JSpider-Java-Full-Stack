=> Cloning :-
==============
--> Creating exact copy of an object is called as Cloning.
--> In java, we can clone the objects by using object class clone().
--> clone() will clone only cloneable type object.
--> If objects are not cloneable type, we will get "clonenotsupported" exception.
--> In java, Cloning is two types,
		1 - Shallow Cloning  
		2 - Deep Cloning
		
1. Shallow Cloning :-
======================
--> Shallow Cloning is a type of cloning, in shallow cloning referred property will not copy instead reference will copy.
--> Which means, In shallow cloning, original object and clone object will refer some instances of referred object.
--> In shallow cloning if we do any change in cloned object then it will reflect in original object.

2. Deep Cloning :-
===================
--> Deep cloning is a type of cloning, In deep cloning, Object will clone along with referred properties.
--> In deep cloning, cloned objects are independent, if we do any changes in cloned objects it will not reflect in original object.
