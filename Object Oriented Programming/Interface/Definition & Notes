=> Interface :-
================
--> interface is a intermediate between service provider & user program.
--> interface is a non-primitive type.
--> We can create a interface by using "interface" keyword.
--> In interface we can declare only variables & methods.
--> By default, interface variables are "public static final".
--> By default, interface methods are "public abstract".
--> To implement interface java providing "implements" keyword.
--> Which classes are implementing interface those classes are called as implementing sub classes.
--> Implementing sub classes will provide implementation for interface abstract method otherwise Implementing sub class will be declared as "abstract".
--> We cann't instantiate interface.
--> In java, one class can implement 'n' number of interface.

			Example :- class A implements I1,I2,I3...
					Here, I1,I2,I3 are interfaces.
					
--> In java, One class can extends one class & can implements multiple interface at the same time.
		But, In this scenario, First we have to write "extends" keyword then "implements" keyword.
		
			Example :- class B extends A implements I1,I2
					Here, A is a class & I1,I2 are interfaces
					
--> Till 'JDK-7' interface having only public & abstract methods and data members.
--> Interface doesn't allow to create constructors and blocks.

=> Interface Type Based on abstract function :-
================================================
1 - Regular Interface
2 - Functional Interface
3 - Marker Interface

1 - Regular Interface :-
-------------------------
--> Other than, Functional Interface & Marker Interface remaining all interfaces are Regular interface.

2 - Functional Interface :-
----------------------------
--> Which interfaces having only one abstract function those interfaces are called as Functional Interface.
--> A functional interface can have 'n' number of "default", "static", "private" methods but abstract method count should be One.
--> To indicate functional interfaces, java providing "@FunctionalInterface" annotation.
--> Some pre-defined functional interface are Runnable, Comparable, Comparator ,...etc.

3 - Marker Interface :-
------------------------
--> Marker interface does not contain any functions or data members.
--> Marker interface also known as Empty Interface or Tagged Interface.
--> Marker interface is used to give special instruction to JVM.
