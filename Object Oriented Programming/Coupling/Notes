=> Coupling :-
===============
--> Coupling in Java refers to the degree of dependency or interaction between two classes or modules in a program.
--> It is of two types.
		1 - Tight Coupling 
		2 - Loose Coupling
		
1 - Tight Coupling :-
======================
--> Service provider Program and User program is connected such a way, if any changes made in service provider program, directly it will affect in user program this scenario is called as Tight Coupling.
									
									OR
									
--> If a class relies heavily on the details of another class, they are tightly coupled. Changes in one class will likely affect the other.

2 - Loose Coupling :-
======================
--> Service provider Program and User program is connected such a way, if any changes made in service provider program, directly it will not affect in user program this scenario is called as Loose Coupling.

									OR
									
--> If a class has minimal dependency on another, they are loosely coupled. This makes the code more flexible, easier to maintain, and test.
