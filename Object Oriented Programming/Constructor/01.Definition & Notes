=> Constructor :-
==================
--> Constructor is a special type non-static method or special type non-static multi-line initializer in java.
--> Constructor is a set of statements, it will get executed immediately after object creation.
--> Constructor name should be same name as class name.
--> Constructor does not have return type.
--> Constructor is used to initialize non-static data members.
--> Constructor cann't be static.
--> Constructor will get executed for every object creation.
--> We can create constructor with Argument or Without Argument.

=> No-Argument Constructor :-
==============================
--> Which constructor does not have a formal argument that constructor is called as No-Argument Constructor.

=> Parameterized Constructor :-
================================
--> Which constructor having formal argument as parameter that constructor is called as No-Argument Constructor.
--> To call parameterized constructor number of formal argument and number of actual argument should be same.

=> Default Constructor :-
==========================
--> In a class if there is no constructor, compiler will add a constructor at compile time that constructor is called as Default Constructor.
--> Default Constructor is a no-argument constructor.
--> In java every class should have at least one constructor.

=> Advantages of Constructor :- 
================================
--> Constructor is used to initialize objects.
--> Constructor is used to initialize non-static data members of class.

=> Purpose of Constructor :-
=============================
--> Constructor will load all non-static data members to the heap area.
--> Constructor is used to execute all the non-static blocks in TOP-BOTTOM order.
