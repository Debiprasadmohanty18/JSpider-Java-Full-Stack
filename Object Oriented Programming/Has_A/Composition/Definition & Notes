=> Composition :-
==================
--> Composition is a form of Has-A relationship.
--> We can achieve composition by placing one class reference variable into another class.
--> In Composition one object cann't exist without another object.
--> Composition is a strong dependency between two objects.
--> Composition represents real world "Has-A" relationship.
--> Composition is a type of Aggregation.

Example :- Mobile and MotherBoard, Car and Engine
			because, Without MotherBoard and Engine every Mobile and Car will not work perfectly.
			

=> Advantages Of "Has-A" Relationship :-
=========================================
--> Code Re-usability.
--> We can improve Code Readability.
--> Without inheritance, we can access one class property into another class.
