=> Inheritance :- 
==================
--> Acquiring Properties from one class to another class is known as Inheritance.
--> Inheritance also known as "IS A" Relationship in java.
--> We can achieve "IS A" relationship by using "extends" keyword.
--> Inheritance represent real world Parent & Child relation.
--> In java, One Class can extends only one class.

=> Super Class :-
==================
--> From which class properties are acquiring that class is called as Super Class.
--> Super Class is also known as Parent Class Or Base Class.

=> Sub Class :-
================
--> To which class properties are acquired that class is called as Sub Class.
--> Sub Class is also known as Child Class or Derived Class.

=> Types Of Inheritance :-
===========================

1 - Single-Level Inheritance :- 
--------------------------------
* The inheritance between 1- parent class & 1- child class is called as Single level inheritance.
									
2 - Multi-Level Inheritance :-
-------------------------------
* One class is acting as a parent & child at a same time is called as Multi-level Inheritance.

3 - Hierarchical Inheritance :-
--------------------------------
* One parent class having multiple child classes is called as Hierarchical Inheritance.

4 - Multiple Inheritance :-
----------------------------
* One sub class having multiple Super classes is called as Multiple Inheritance.
* Multiple Inheritance is not supported in java because of Diamond Problem.

5 - Hybrid Inheritance :-
---------------------------
* Combination of Multiple Inheritance & Hierarchical Inheritance is called as Hybrid Inheritance.
* Hybrid Inheritance is not supported in java because It is the combination of Hierarchical Inheritance & Multiple Inheritance.



Notes :-
=========
--> By using sub class reference we can access all parent class properties.
--> By using super class reference we cann't access sub class specific properties.



Q-1:- WHICH PROPERTIES WE CAN INHERIT FROM PARENT TO CHILD CLASS ?
Ans:- In java, only non-static variables and methods can be inherited from parent to child class.

Q-2:- WHICH PROPERTY WILL NOT INHERIT FROM PARENT TO CHILD CLASS ?
Ans :- In java, static and private methods are not inherited from super class to sub class AND Constructor and Blocks also will not take part in inheritance.
