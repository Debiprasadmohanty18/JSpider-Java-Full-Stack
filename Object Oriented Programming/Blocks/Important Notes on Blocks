=> Blocks :- 
=============
-->It is used to initialize the data members.
--> Blocks will get executed before Constructor.

---------> Blocks are two types.
		      1 - Static Block
		      2 - Non-Static Block
		      
1 - Static Block :- 
====================
				
				syntax :- static 
						  {
						  	// Statements
						  }	
						  	 
--> Static Block are used to initialize static data members of a class.
--> Static Block is also known as Multi-line Static Initializer.
--> Inside Static block we cann't initialize non-static data member.
--> Static block will get executed during class load time.
--> Static block will get executed before actual execution.
--> In a class we can declare 'n' number of static block and all static block will get executed top-bottom order.

2 - Non-Static Block :-
======================== 
	
				syntax :- {
							// Non-Static Block 
						  }   
						  
--> Non- Static Block is used to initialize non-static data members of a class.
--> Non-static block will get executed when object is going to create.
--> Inside non-static block we can initialize both static and non-static data members.   
--> In a class we can create 'n' number of non-static blocks. And all non-static block will get executed top to bottom order when object will create.
