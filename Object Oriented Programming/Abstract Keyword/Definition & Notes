=> "abstract" :-
=================
--> "abstract" is a Keyword or non-access modifier.
--> We can use abstract keyword only for classes & methods.

=> Concrete Class :-
=====================
--> Which Class does not have any abstract method that class is known as Concrete Class.
--> It will not allow to create abstract function.

=> Concrete Method :-
======================
--> A method with complete implementation is called as Concrete Method.
--> Concrete methods are allowed to create inside concrete class & inside abstract class.

=> abstract Class :-
=====================
--> Which class prefixed with abstract keyword those classes known as abstract class.
--> We cann't make final class as abstract class.
--> We cann't create object for abstract class.
--> We cann't achieve up-casting between two abstract classes.
--> Without abstract methods also we can make a class as abstract class.
--> If any class having at least one abstract method, It is mandatory to make that class as abstract class.
--> abstract class can contain concrete methods, constructors, blocks, variables etc.
--> abstract class can be inherited to another class.
--> abstract class is also incomplete class.
--> By abstract class we can achieve Abstraction.

=> abstract Method :-
======================
--> Which method having abstract keyword as modifier those methods are called as abstract method.
--> abstract method also known as incomplete method.
--> abstract method does not contain any method implementation.
--> abstract methods are always ended with semicolon(;).
--> The extending sub class will provide the implementation for abstract method.
--> If extending sub class not overriding abstract methods then we have to make extending sub class as abstract.
--> Final, Static, Private methods cann't be an abstract method.
--> We can make only non-static, non-final, non-private methods as abstract methods.
--> We can create abstract methods, only inside abstract class.
