=> Encapsulation :-
====================
--> Wrapping data members and member functions in a single unit is called as data encapsulation.
--> Perfect Encapsulated class should have all private data members and to access private data members, public methods.
--> Encapsulation is also known as Data Hiding Process.
--> In data encapsulation data functions will act on the data(Means Without member functions we cann't access variables).
--> We can achieve data encapsulation by making data members as private.
--> Private data members we cann't access outside of the class directly.
--> We can access private data members by using public methods i.e getter() & setter().

=> getter() :-
---------------
--> Getter methods are used to get the private variable's value outside of the class.
--> Getter methods are always "Public".

=> setter() :-
---------------
--> Setter methods are used to modify or update the private variable's value outside of the class.
--> Setter methods are always "Public".

=> Advantages of Data Encapsulation :-
=======================================
--> By using data encapsulation, we can achieve data security in java.
--> A class can have full control on its data.
--> We can verify & validate the data before modifying the data.
--> By using data encapsulation , we can make private variable as,
						-- Only Readable.
						-- Only Modifiable.
						-- Both Readable & Modifiable.
						-- Neither Readable or Modifiable.
