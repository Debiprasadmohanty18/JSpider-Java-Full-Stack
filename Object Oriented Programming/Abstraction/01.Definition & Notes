=> Abstraction :- 
==================
--> Hiding Complex implementation from user and providing necessary functionalities to the user called as Abstraction.
--> In Java, We can achieve abstraction in two ways, By Using --
 		1 - abstract Class      2 - interface
--> Interface is a type which contains abstract functions.
--> In interface we can declare the be-haviour, which is required for user.
--> The Service provider's will provide detailed implementations for interface abstract methods.
--> For user, interface details is enough to use service provider's program.
		so, user can develop his own implementation for interface type without knowing any details implementing classes.
--> Abstraction is also known as implementation hiding.

=> Advantages Of Abstraction :- 
================================
--> By using Abstraction,
		-- We can achieve implementation hiding.
		-- We can achieve loose coupling.
		-- We can achieve user friendly program.
