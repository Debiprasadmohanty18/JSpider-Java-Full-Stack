=> Aggregation :-
==================
--> Aggregation is a form of Has-A relationship.
--> We can achieve aggregation by placing one class reference variable into another class.
--> In aggregation one object can exist without another object.
--> Aggregation is a weak dependency between two objects.
--> Aggregation represents real world "Has-A" relationship.

Example :- Mobile and SimCard, Car and Music Player
			because, Without SimCard and Music Player every Mobile and Car will work perfectly.
