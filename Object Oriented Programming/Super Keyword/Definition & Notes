=> Super Keyword :-
====================
--> In parent class and child class if, it is having same non-static data members to access parent class data member we need to use "SUPER KEYWORD".
											OR
--> By Using Super keyword we can access immediate parent class data members & member functions.

--> Super Keyword can be used in any line of the statements.
--> If you want to use super keyword, Parent & Child relationship/Inheritance is mandatory.
--> Super keyword is always Explicit.
--> We cann't use super keyword inside static context.


=> Call to Super / super(); :- 
===============================
--> "super();" is used to call Constructor From Parent Class to Child Class.
--> "super();" always should be in the first line of the every constructor.
--> By using "super();" we can achieve constructor chaining.
--> "super();" is always Implicit.
--> "super();" is used to call immediate parent class constructor.
--> In java, every constructor having default call to super statements.
--> We cann't use "this();" & "super();" in the same constructor.


Q-1 :- When we will write super(); explicitly ?
Ans :- If parent class having parameterized constructor, to call parent class parameterized constructor to call parent class parameterized constructor
	we have to write parameterized super(); in child class.
