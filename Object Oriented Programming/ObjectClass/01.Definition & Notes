1- toString() :-
=================
--> toString() is a non-static method of object class.
--> When we trying to print a reference variable of object, implicitly toString() will be called.
--> Object class toString() will print String representation which is not meaningful.
--> By Overriding toString(), we can provide meaningful representation according to object state.
--> In String class toString() is already overriden.
