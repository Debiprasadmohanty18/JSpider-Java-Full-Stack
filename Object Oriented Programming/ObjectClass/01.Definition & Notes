=> Object Class :-
===================
--> Object class is super most class in java.
--> In java every class is sub type for object class.

=> Some Important Methods :- 
-----------------------------
1 - toString()												
2 - equals(Object o)
3 - wait()
4 - wait(long miliSec)
5 - wait(long miliSec, int nanoSec)
6 - hashCode()
7 - clone()
8 - notify()
9 - notifyAll()
10 - getClass()

1- toString() :-
=================
--> toString() is a non-static method of object class.
--> When we trying to print a reference variable of object, implicitly toString() will be called.
--> Object class toString() will print String representation which is not meaningful.
--> By Overriding toString(), we can provide meaningful representation according to object state.
--> In String class toString() is already overriden.

2- equals(Object o) :-
=======================
--> equals() is a non-static method of object class.
--> equals() is used to compare two objects are equal or not.
--> Object class equals() will compare two object references.
--> After overriding equals(), it will compare two object values are equal or not.
--> equals() is used to non-primitive type values.
--> In string class equals() is already overridden.

--------------->   this.name == e.name --> This is not a proper way to check.
--------------->   this.name.equals(e.name)  --> This is a proper way to check.
