=> Polymorphism :-
===================
--> Polymorphism is a Greek word, where 'POLY' means "many" & 'MORPHISM' means "forms".
--> One Entity showing the behaviour of another entity is called as Polymorphism.
--> In Polymorphism, one object can have ability to show different behaviours.
--> It is of two types.
		1 - Compile-time Polymorphism 
		2 - Run-time Polymorphism

1 - Compile-time Polymorphism :-
=================================
--> Call to the overloaded method resolved at compile time by compiler based on method name and arguments called as Compile-time Polymorphism.
--> We can achieve compile time polymorphism by using "method overloading".
--> It is also known as Static Polymorphism.

2 - Run-time Polymorphism :-
============================= 
--> Call to the Overridden method resolved as run-time by JVM based on which instance we created is called as Run-time Polymorphism.
--> We can achieve Run-time Polymorphism by using "method overriding".
--> It is also known as Dynamic Polymorphism.
